I am Mirco and I am currently studying Computer Science at the university of Basel.

Here are some projects I already worked on for the lectures:

For the "Programmierprojekt" in the second semester we created a multiplayer videogame called [Cerberus](https://github.com/schn-lars/Cerberus2.0). This was done in a group of four.

In the third semester we created an add-on for the citation and reference management tool JabRef for the "Software Engineering" lecture. Here we created a [rewarding system](https://github.com/troberts97/jabref) with achievements for JabRef. The project had to be done in a group of three.

More physical was the "Computer Architecture" project where we build a hand-held console with an Arduino. On there we implemented the classical game "Pong" with some additional features.

For the "Operating Systems" lecture we created a new shell called [DAVIS](https://github.com/schn-lars/Project) in a group of two. The shell has all the basic commands and some additional features like the plotting of graphs and the creating of LaTeX templates.

In the "Distributed Programming and Internet Security" lecture we implemented the game Battle Ship over the Bluetooth low-energy app "Tremola". For that we mainly used Kotlin and JavaScript.

Currently I am working on my Bachelor's thesis in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I implemented a new tie-breaking strategy for benchmarks which use 0-cost actions in the general planner programm [Fast Downward](https://github.com/aibasel/downward).

At the university I learned coding in Java, Python, C, C++, Assembler and bash. For the mathematical part of the lectures I used LaTeX and MatLab.
