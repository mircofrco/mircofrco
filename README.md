I am Mirco and I am currently studying Computer Science at the university of Basel.

Here are some projects I already worked on for the lectures:

For the "Programmierprojekt" in the second semester we created a videogame called [Cerberus](https://github.com/schn-lars/Cerberus2.0). This was done in a group of four.

In the third semester we created an add-on for the citation and reference management tool JabRef for the "Software Engineering" lecture. Here we created a [rewarding system](https://github.com/troberts97/jabref) with achievements for JabRef. The project had to be done in a group of three.

For the "Operating Systems" lecture we created a new shell called [DAVIS](https://github.com/schn-lars/Project) in a group of two. The shell has all the basic commands and some additional features like the plotting and the creating of LaTeX templates.

At the university I learned coding in Java, Python, C, Assembler and bash. For the mathematical part of the lectures I used LaTeX and MatLab.
